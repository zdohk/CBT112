Hi Sam,

I documented the change in the $MODS member, as well as in the
comments at the top of several programs.  I was unable to use the
VTOC command "ALL" option due to the number of volumes we have.

My changes are as follows:

I converted VTOC from AMODE24 to AMODE31 and moved the VTOC table
above-the-line.

I increased the max size of the VTOC table large enough so that I
could use the VTOC ALL option.

Thanks,
Wade
