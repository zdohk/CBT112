 Hello Sam,

 I was recently downloading a refresh of the VTOC (CBT File 112)
 command.  I was looking for an option to suppress the Total line
 in additional to the Heading line.

 While looking through the VT0CPRNT member, I noticed code
 checking for a "No Total" option:

PRNTOT ST R8,PRNTTOT8 SAVE THE RETURN ADDRESS
*
CLI TOTALK+1,2 NO TOTALS? HXF-ALL
BER R8 RETURN HXF-ALL
*

 However, when I checked the VTOCPARS member, no such option was
 present. I have recoded the IKJPARS macro at label TOTALK, as
 follows:

TOTALK IKJKEYWD
IKJNAME 'TOTALS',SUBFLD=SUBTOTAL
IKJNAME 'NOTOTALS'

 After a quick reassemble and link, I have a new VTOC command that
 supports both the NOHEADING and NOTOTALS options.  I just wanted
 to bring this to your attention, if you were not aware of it.

 Many thanks for your support of a great TSO command!!!
