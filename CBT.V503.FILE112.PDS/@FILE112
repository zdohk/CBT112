//***FILE 112 is the source for the TSO command prompter called     *   FILE 112
//*          VTOC.  This file is in IEBUPDTE form.  This command    *   FILE 112
//*          allows you to search the Volume Table Of Contents of   *   FILE 112
//*          one or more disk volumes and obtain listings or totals *   FILE 112
//*          of data sets meeting some criteria.  The specification *   FILE 112
//*          is quite flexible.  This file also contains the HELP   *   FILE 112
//*          data set for this command.   It also contains          *   FILE 112
//*          installation notes, some comments on defaults that may *   FILE 112
//*          not be typical elsewhere,  a list of the known errors  *   FILE 112
//*          in the command,  and ideas for future expansion.       *   FILE 112
//*          This version supports SU60, cataloged datasets and the *   FILE 112
//*          ability to sort the output on anything.  For additional*   FILE 112
//*          changes see the help member of the PDS.                *   FILE 112

//*          Tony Cieri added an option to VTOC of NOTOTALS,        *   FILE 112
//*          which will not produce a TOTALS line.  This seems      *   FILE 112
//*          to have been intended by the author, but an            *   FILE 112
//*          IKJNAME 'NOTOTALS' line needed to be added to the      *   FILE 112
//*          IKJPARS statements.                                    *   FILE 112
